# MyReads Project [![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

This project was released previously by me with a different udacity account through the workspace. I have updated this to run from create-react-app but the content is largely the same.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

Install all project dependencies with `npm install`

## Run

Start the development server with `npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
